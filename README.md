# CS-312-MiniProject-1
First project for NAU's CS312 course.

## description
This project aims to develop a basic blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The app will enable users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. Responsiveness and styling will be key aspects to ensure an enhanced user experience. No database will be used, so posts will not persist between sessions.
